#[Hey there,](http://www.Danwakeem.com)

## This is my Mars Mips simulator that I made for a school project.

* **MAKE SURE YOU COMPILE WITH -lm FLAG:**

* gcc Jarvis.c -lm -o yourEXEName

## I have coppied the hex files that the professor gave to us to run and put them in the text(i).txt files and I made input files to try them out. 

### To try mine out just pipe a text file in when you run. Like so:

* a.out < input.txt
* a.out < input2.txt

### You may also try your own by following the directions of the program. 

Enjoy,
Dan Jarvis
